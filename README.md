# Deploying Cloud Native Qumulo (CNQ) on GCP Using Terraform [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/qumulo/gcp-terraform-cnq.svg)](https://github.com/qumulo/gcp-terraform-gcp/releases)
This repository contains comprehensive Terraform modules that let you deploy Google Cloud Storage buckets and then create a CNQ cluster with 1 or 3 to 24 VMs that are well-architected and have fully elastic compute and persistent object storage.

## Getting Started with Cloud Native Qumulo (CNQ)
For an overview of CNQ, its reference architecture, and limits, see [How Cloud Native Qumulo Works](https://docs.qumulo.com/cloud-native-gcp-administrator-guide/getting-started/how-cloud-native-qumulo-works.html) and for prerequisites and detailed instructions, see [Deploying Cloud Native Qumulo on GCP with Terraform](https://docs.qumulo.com/cloud-native-gcp-administrator-guide/getting-started/terraform.html) on the Documentation Portal.

Qumulo Core >= 7.6.0 is required for this Terraform

> âœ… **Tip:** For help with deployment, configuration, updates, scaling out your cluster, and best practices for high performance, [message us on Slack](https://docs.qumulo.com/contacting-qumulo-care-team.html).

### Description of Modules in This Repository
There are two modules in this repository *persistent-storage* and *compute*.  The *persistent-storage* module creates the GCS buckets for all data the Qumulo cluster stores.
The *compute* module creates the GCE VMs and the Qumulo NeuralCache which form the compute resources for the cluster.

### Terraform deployment
You may choose to deploy each module using the `terraform.tfvars` file with your specific variable values.  Alternatively, if you are integrating into a CI/CD pipeline, you may
opt to call the module directly passing in the variables for the module.

---

### Terraform state management
By default the `provider.tf` files in each module are configured to write state to GCS.  It is absolutely critical that the state for each module is in a separate Terraform state file.
If deploying the modules as packaged and using the `terraform.tfvars` file you need only configure the bucket for GCS state storage in each `provider.tf`.  
Terraform will then create a 'tfstate' folder with unique subfolders for the state files for persistent-storage and compute.  This must be done prior to `terraform init`.  
If you are integrating this into your own CI/CD pipeline and calling the modules directly ensure that state is managed independently for both modules.
